          <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
            Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
            Which alters when it alteration finds<br>
            Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
            <br>
            <!-- O, no, it is an ever-fixèd mark<br>
            That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
            It is the star to every wand’ring bark,<br>
            Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
            Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
            Within his bending sickle’s compass come;<br>
            Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
            But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
             If this be error, and upon me proved,<br>
             I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<br> -->
