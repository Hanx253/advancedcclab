        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
        And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,
        By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed.</p>

                <p>That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br>
                    When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br>
                    Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br>
                    Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.<br>
                    In me thou see’st the twilight of such day<br>
                    As after sunset fadeth in the west,<br>
                    Which by and by black night doth take away,<br>
                    Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest.<br>
                    In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire<br>
                    That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<br>
                    As the death-bed whereon it must expire,<br>
                    Consumed with that which it was nourished by.<br>
                     This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,<br>
                     To love that well which thou must leave ere long.<br>

            <p>But be contented when that fell arrest<br>
                Without all bail shall carry me away,<br>
                My life hath in this line some interest,<br>
                Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<br>
                When thou reviewest this, thou dost review<br>
                The very part was consecrate to thee.<br>
                The earth can have but earth, which is his due;<br>
                My spirit is thine, the better part of me.<br>
                So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<br>
                The prey of worms, my body being dead,<br>
                The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,<br>
                Too base of thee to be rememberèd.<br>
                 The worth of that is that which it contains,<br>
                 And that is this, and this with thee remains.<br>
