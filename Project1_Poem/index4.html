                <p>
                    Who will believe my verse in time to come<br>
                    If it were filled with your most high deserts?<br>
                    Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb<br>
                    Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.<br>
                    If I could write the beauty of your eyes<br>
                    And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
                    The age to come would say “This poet lies;<br>
                    Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.”<br>
                    So should my papers, yellowed with their age,<br>
                    Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
                    And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage<br>
                    And stretchèd meter of an antique song.<br>
                     But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
                     You should live twice—in it and in my rhyme.<br>
